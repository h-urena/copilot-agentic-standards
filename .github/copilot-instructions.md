# Copilot instructions for this repo

You are working on the **copilot-agentic-standards** repo — the single source of truth for Copilot instructions, reusable workflows, PR templates, and MCP configs that get distributed to all downstream repositories.

## Key context

- `instructions/base.md` is the universal instruction set; all stacks inherit from it.
- Stack-specific files in `instructions/stacks/` are **additive** — they never contradict `base.md`.
- Files in `composed/` are **auto-generated** by `scripts/compose.sh`. Never edit them directly.
- Workflows in `.github/workflows/` use dual triggers (`pull_request` for this repo + `workflow_call` for consumers). Files in `workflows/reusable/` are documentation only.

## MANDATORY pre-flight — execute every step, every time, before touching any file

> **STOP.** Do not create, edit, or delete any file until all nine steps below are complete.
> This applies to every change, no matter how small or "obvious".

**Step 1 — Verify main is up to date**

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**Step 2 — Create a GitHub issue**

- Title: `<type>(<scope>): <short description>` using Conventional Commits format
- Body: describe the problem, proposed solution, and acceptance criteria
- Assign to yourself
- Record the issue number — you will need it for every subsequent step

```bash
gh issue create --title "<type>(scope): short description" --body "Problem, solution, acceptance criteria" --assignee @me
```

**Step 3 — Create a branch linked to that issue**

Branch naming format: `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-slug>`

Valid types: `feat` `fix` `docs` `style` `refactor` `perf` `test` `build` `ci` `chore` `hotfix`

Examples: `feat/42-add-oauth-flow`, `fix/99-null-crash-on-login`, `chore/35-mvp-hardening`

```bash
git checkout -b <type>/<issue-number>-<short-slug>
```

**Step 4 — Implement the change**

- Make only the changes required to resolve the issue
- Do not refactor unrelated code or add unrequested features
- If editing composed files is needed, edit the source (`instructions/`) and regenerate: `./scripts/compose.sh all`

**Step 5 — Run local validation**

```bash
# Lint all shell scripts
shellcheck scripts/*.sh

# Re-compose and verify committed files match
./scripts/compose.sh all
./scripts/validate-composed.sh
```

Fix all errors before continuing. If `validate-composed.sh` reports stale files, commit the regenerated output before pushing.

Run these review prompts before opening the PR — zero exceptions:
- `#audit` — every PR without exception.
- `#security-audit` — any PR touching workflows, scripts, permissions, auth, or external inputs.
- `#dependency-audit` — any PR that adds, removes, or changes a dependency.
- `#performance-audit` — any PR touching database queries, caching, or data-intensive operations.

**Step 6 — Commit using Conventional Commits**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body explaining what and why>

Closes #<issue-number>"
```

> The subject line must be **≤ 100 characters** — `commitlint` enforces this in CI.

**Step 7 — Push and open a Pull Request**

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
gh pr create \
  --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" \
  --body "Closes #<issue-number>

## Changes
- <what changed and why it matters>

## Why
- <problem solved or requirement met>" \
  --assignee @me
```

**Step 8 — Wait for all CI checks to pass**

Do not merge until every check is green:
- `Validate PR title (Conventional Commits)`
- `Verify squash merge is enabled`
- `Validate branch name`
- `Check composed files are fresh`
- `Lint shell scripts`
- `Tiered Review` (must not have REQUEST_CHANGES findings)

If any check fails, fix it on the branch and push again. Never bypass checks.

**Step 9 — Merge via squash only**

```bash
gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
```

If you skipped any step, stop immediately, undo your changes (`git checkout main`), and restart from Step 1.

**Non-negotiable rules:**
- Never push directly to `main`
- Never use `--force` on `main`
- Never skip CI
- Every change must trace to an issue number

**Project board:** `project-automation.yml` drives all card transitions automatically. Creating the
issue (Step 2) adds it to **Todo**; pushing the branch moves it to **In Progress**; opening the PR
moves it to **In Review**; merge moves it to **Done**. Never move cards manually.

**Dependabot PRs:** When Dependabot opens a PR, follow these steps without exception:
1. Wait for all CI checks to pass.
2. **Patch or minor bump + green CI** — merge immediately:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge <pr-number> --squash --delete-branch
   ```
3. **Major version bump** — read the package changelog, check for breaking changes, update affected
   code and tests on a new branch (following Steps 1–9 above), then merge.
4. Never merge a Dependabot PR with failing CI.
5. Never close a Dependabot PR without merging it unless the dependency is being intentionally removed.

## Rules when editing this repo

1. **Never edit files in `composed/`** — regenerate with `./scripts/compose.sh all`.
2. Keep instructions **declarative and concise**. Use imperative mood ("Use", "Do not", "Prefer").
3. When adding a new stack, create `instructions/stacks/<stack>.md`, add a `mcp/<stack>.mcp.json` if applicable, and update `scripts/compose.sh`.
4. Workflow files must use `workflow_call` trigger for reusable workflows.
5. Follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`. Add a `scope` when applicable (e.g., `feat(frontend): add UI component`).
6. Shell scripts must pass `shellcheck` with zero warnings and use `set -euo pipefail`. Never suppress a warning with `# shellcheck disable` as a first resort — fix the root cause. For SC2016 (dollar sign in single quotes), assign the string with double quotes and `\$` to produce a literal `$` without shell expansion (e.g. `Q="query(\$id:ID!){...}"`). Single-quoted assignment still triggers SC2016 — do not use it.
